I'm a storyteller and illustrator working in graphite, marker, oil pastel, and digital collage. Heartfelt moments and humor are underlying themes throughout my work as a creator. I have over a decade of experience working with children as a Teaching Assistant and Daycare Provider. While working as a Teaching Assistant at the Cleveland Institute of Art, I further developed my passion for children's literature. I was fortunate to become friends and connect with many of the children I was helping instruct. As I got to know each of the children, they began sharing their stories and experiences about loneliness, anxiety, and fitting in. Using these interactions as my inspiration, I created stories for them. My continued work on these stories has become my unique driving force. It has allowed me to develop designs that tell a sensitive and expressive story.<br>
