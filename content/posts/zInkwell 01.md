*An area to share the things and processes going on in my studio/practice.*<br>

#### Process. Writing. Seeking. Repeating. 
I know it’s a bit wasteful, but there is something about working from paper and writing my thoughts out. For my early stages of writing it all takes place in writing, which becomes a cycle as I will start a project and write out a bunch of thoughts, then I take those thoughts and type them into my writing app (Ulysses) and then from that I will print out those notes, ideas and inspirations. I then take those sheets and highlight and markup those sheets and see where they guide me. Sort of my past self guiding my present self, I will take notes on things I need to research and understand which is then when I take my time to go on consumption journeys of finding stories from others that I can draw from and this sort of helps me take my rough and sharp ideas and start chipping away at the things that don’t work or the places where I need to choose a direction. These journeys seeking inspiration and sparks can last anywhere to a few minutes to a few weeks. I scour films, tv, games, blogs, and any avenue of reflective thought to find what I don’t even know what I’m seeking exactly. Then once I’ve taken notes on a few new sources of how others have solved their problems I take their blue prints and see if/how they compare to the problem I have in front of me with my stories. Then I begin writing and cross referencing my previous notes and writing. Then the cycle continues as I dive deeper into this hand writing stage and then refining digitally and then printing and then again seeking. Rinse. Repeat. 
I do this with multiple projects so I can consistently write daily while also taking breaks to be seeking answers and learning. I never know what ideas will hit me but for the most part in keeping a daily practice of writing and seeking I am able to craft these stories that I believe in.

#### A Jolt of Yellow
This year we remodeled the studio and infused it with some creative sunshine, going from a drab grey blue to an impactful yellow that has really encouraged and excited me to write this year. I love spending time in this space and being able to work on multiple projects in different spaces has done wonders with my creative flow.

#### Pastel Breakthrough
I spent months trying to figure out how I wanted to refine this illustration and I am absolutely peached with how the final illustration came out, all the time and paper spent on this specific project was more than any other this year. I had a lot of trouble with the mixture of mediums that I am utilizing in this piece. In a lot of my pieces I use a combination of marker, graphite and pastel. With this one and the smudging and heavier mixing of those mediums cause a lot of ugly combination of colors and messy compositions and refinements. A lot of the problem would arise from the graphite and pastel not mixing well as the pastel would mix into the pastel and go places it shouldn’t and case a lot of the illustration to look like it had been smeared with vaseline. The answer that probably took too long to come to me, was to seal the graphite layer and then work in pastel over the top of everything. That allows the graphite to keep its texture and look without mixing into the pastels in an unwanted manner. Doing this also allowed me to be painterly with the pastels and achieve moments in the illustration that were spontaneous.

#### Soft Fronts & Strong Backs

Just a reminder we are connected and should continue to show that grace to others.

#### An actual (maybe?) use for AI

> “Computer methods have also recovered missing attributes or portions of incomplete artworks, such as the probable style and colours of ghost paintings — works that have been painted over and are later revealed by imaging in X-rays or infrared radiation — such as Two Wrestlers by Vincent van Gogh. This painting, from before 1886, was mentioned by the artist in a letter but considered lost until it was found beneath another in 2012.”

AI as a tool utilized by humans is interesting in helping uncover mysteries (AI as the product to replacing artist and writers, not so much).

As someone that always idealized the idea of solo backpacking but has been slowly building a family, it’s nice to see a family taking on the task of a Pacific Coast Trek.

So we’re the monster police, too?” I said to Tom.
“Correct,” he replied. “The only real question is, who are the monsters?”
“They ask that question in every monster movie, you know. It’s an actual trope.”
“I know,” Tom said. “What does it say about us that it’s relevant every single time they ask it?

#### Role Playing Adventures

>"I was so scared, I half wanted to piss myself, but the difference between the strong and the weak isn't that the strong don't piss themselves. It's that they hitch their pissy pants up after and go through with it."<br>
Christopher Buehlman, The Blacktongue Thief

Big fan of fantasy... escaping can lead the mind to unexpected connections

#### Anxiety & Mystery

> “It means no matter how far you’re thinking or your actions, or your reactions, no matter how far out it is. It is still not far enough, because one challenge, if it’s worthy at all, has to be followed by a greater challenge and it is the unknown, that’s what’s so fantastic about death, and that’s why death has to be welcomed and when ‘I’ die, I’ll find out what’s behind that far out.” <br>
-Tomi Ungerer

It’s funny what we gravitate towards that ultimately is exactly the we need in our lives. I'm writing a story on fear of the unknown and the anxieties it brings. I found myself diving into two drastically different shows. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>The Bear</u></a> overwhelms every sense and inch of mind with anxiety and the unknown. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1466074/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>Columbo</u></a> tells you the end but leaves you clueless about how we get there. Both shows are impeccable storytelling that dabbles in the unknowns and its anxiety.

#### Climbing Mysteries

Has been a great meditative experience of climbing a mysterious mountain in a ravaged land.

#### Tell it to the Bees

Stumbled upon a comment talking about this concept one morning while roaming the web. An interseting tale of the bees and telling your secrets to the universe.

#### Things from the Shore leading to the Deep

It is astounding what the mind creates during times of things falling apart, stories of humans experiecing this sublime feeling as things begin to fall and then the stories after the fall of things continuing deep beneath that leads to discovery.
