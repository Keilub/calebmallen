Sometimes you have to be reminded to do the things you are already familiar with. I recently came across an article from The Marginalian that struck home in regards to things I find myself doing a lot throughout the year, especially during the winter months when my mind feels lost, unfocused and incapable of thoughts, specifically when trying to write.

#### I wanna be me.

> “I didn’t want to learn how to be a New Yorker cartoonist. I wanted to learn how to be me.”<br>
-Roz Chast

<a href="https://apple.news/AOO-0rqvJSPSHz0mqZ7lEkg" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>Apple News In Coversation | Inside the mind of one of the New Yorker's most iconic cartoonists</i></u></a>

A lovely conversation with Roz Chast, in finding style and our own voice so our art meets our needs. Also in the conversation it discusses writing and its dreamlike quality. Just a fantastic and thought provoking article/interview.

#### Puppets and Pinnochio

> “Sometimes, it’s the smallest things that can change everything when you least expect it.”

>“What are the rules?<br>
Stick together!<br>
Run if we have to.<br>
Na dallying!<br>
No drilling.<br>
And above all else, be brave!”<br>

> “He’s not being weak,” Rambo said “He’s recovering.”<br>
“There’s a difference,” Nurse Ratched said. “You do not know Victor like we do, Hap. These things take time.” <br>

<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60784549" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>In the Lives of Puppets by <i>T.J. Klune</i></u></a>

One of the first books I read this year and what an incredible way to begin the year. Lovely characters that develop in impactful and surprising ways as they journey through this world that continues unraveling from beginning to end. The end is a bit hard to read just because of the subject matter, but it is written very well and done with such a soft and lovely touch. I love this book so much and was so engulfed in its world and ability to take the pinnochio formula and fill it with such creativity and a new breath of air. <h style="color:#5ABB71;">★</h>

#### Real Frauds
<a href="https://www.culturedmag.com/article/2023/03/16/han-van-meegeren-forgery-nazi-vermeer" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>Cultured Mag | The Forgery That Outwitted the Nazis</u></a>

When it comes to forgery I'm always reminded of a project we had in art school. We were tasked with visiting the art museum and selecting a piece to copy, to try and replicate it as perfectly as possible down to the strokes. It was oddly a very connecting experience in trying to think like someone else and how and why they were doing what they are doing.

#### Two Over Easy Please
<a href="https://lithub.com/how-a-war-over-eggs-marked-the-early-history-of-san-francisco/" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>Literary Hub | How a War Over Eggs Marked the Early History of San Francisco</u></a>

The Egg War began unofficially in 1848 with the Gold Rush. If that line doesn't entice you enough to read then this interesting oddity of an article just may not be up your ally. 

<h1 style="color: #5ABB71;">5.</h1>

#### Radical Renaissance

<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-surprisingly-radical-roots-of-the-renaissance-fair-180982918/" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>Smithsonian Magazine | The Surprisingly Radical Roots of the Renaissance Fair</u></a>

I would've never guessed the Red Scare would've born the Renaissance fair and allowed it to flourish. For me this whole concept alludes to previous posts on Tomi Ungerer and coping and ultimatly just making the best of situations that then blossom into things we could've never thought to even hope for, to just expect the unexpected.

#### Dung Sisyphus

>But in certain species, dung can spark a collaboration between a male and female.

<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sisyphos/id700513505" style="color: #5ABB71"><u>iOS Game | Sisyphos - A Game About Pushing a Rock</u></a>

I'm sure there are already picture books with this theme, but my mind was bursting with ideas for books after reading the article and then shortly after I stumbled upon a game that will let you role play as sisyphus.

#### Watching Other Brains

I have been watching this guys videos for a few years now, he usually post one every few months and I love them because of the way I can visualize how he solves a problem and creates his own art through machinery and engineering.

Well that's all for now, the new year has been eventful so far and I look forward to more breakthoughs as it continues.<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading,
